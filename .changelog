add route group
    - grouping means a controller which needs to has constraints (middlewares) applied to it's routes.
    - routing using sub router object for better group contraints isolation managemnet
    - atomic route with no group will be declared immediately without using group
    - if a controller has middleware that runs over routes, if will be grouped in default group '/'
